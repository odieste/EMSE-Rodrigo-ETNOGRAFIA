\section{Background}\label{sec-background}
Since its inception, experimentation in SE has sought to strengthen mainly through methodological proposals for guide its process \cite{Basili-1986-ESE,Juristo2001,Kitchenham2002-GuideLinesESE,Wohlin2000}, its replications \cite{Solari2006-ClasAnalLabPaq}, and even its reports \cite{Jedlitschka2005-GuideLinesESE,Carver2010-GuidelinesReplication,Kitchenham:2008b}. This trend could have influenced in the noteworthy increase of experiment instances published nowadays \cite{Sjoberg2005-surveyexperimentsESE,Zendler2001,Dieste2011-CompAnalMetaWhenWich}. Nevertheless, publications of the most important journals and conferences of the ESE community show the use of a wide variety of experiment protocols and reporting formats that go far beyond the aforementioned methodological proposals, and they show that each experiment reported could have included activities conceived of the particular perception of each researcher or group of researchers \cite{Reyes-2018-Statistical-Errors-in-SE}.

Apparently, there remains important details within experimentation that have not yet been fully suitable in SE and still represent a challenge. In this regard, several studies have been published in the literature, where peculiar circumstances are reported, which could respond to this situation; some examples are cited below.

Magalhães et al. \cite{Demagalhaes-2015-SMS-Replications} state that \textquotedblleft Replications of empirical studies play important roles in the construction of knowledge\textquotedblright. Additionally, authors mention that SE replications are  complex tasks to perform, due probably (among other causes) to a las casi inevitables variaciones que existen entre el estudio original y la replicación por razones intencionadas o no intencionadas. Por otra parte, Carver et al. \cite{Carver-2014-Replications-of-SE} de forma concordante indican que \textquotedblleft Replication is an essential part of the experimental paradigm and is considered the cornerstone of scientific knowledge \textquotedblright; así mismo indican que \textquotedblleft Replication of empirical software engineering studies has not yet attracted enough attention from researchers\textquotedblright. Es difícil entender este comportamiento inconsistente con la indudable importancia de las replicaciones en la construcción del conocimiento. Si bien es cierto, es complicado llevar a cabo una replicación en SE, pero no es una justificación para la carencia de replicaciones de los experimentos reportados \cite{da-silva-2012-replication-on-empirical-studies}. 

There are groups of similar experimental studies (statistically speaking) applying different statistical techniques for their analysis, that in some cases incurre in methodological errors, which cause uncertainty at the time of opting for one of the several existing experiments' analysis techniques \cite{Reyes-2009-Statistical-Errors-in-SE}.

Practitioners still have serious doubts about the validity of findings obtained from empirical research performed in SE \cite{Lo-2015-Practitioners-Perceive}, despite the vast amount of studies carried out in academia \cite{Sjoberg2005-surveyexperimentsESE} and lately in industry \cite{dieste-2013-industry-experiments}.

Por el contrario, otras disciplinas experimentales tradicionales tienen currently a very rigorous and uniform process \cite{stoker-2009-iLAP-bioinformatics,Jones-2007-FUGE,ko-2012-SMISB}.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item There is a growing trend in SE to carry out experiments \cite{Sjoberg2005-surveyexperimentsESE,Zendler2001,Dieste2011-CompAnalMetaWhenWich}, but the percentage of replications performed so far does not harmonize to such experimentation \cite{da-silva-2012-replication-on-empirical-studies}, which could minimize the validity of its findings.
%  \item According to several authors \cite{Demagalhaes-2015-SMS-Replications,Gomez-2014-understanding-replication,Carver-2014-Replications-of-SE}, the lack of replications in SE is due primarily to there is uncertainty at the time of opting for one of the several existing mechanisms of replication, and that, none of them has been totally effective.
%  \item There are basic guidelines to perform experiments and hence replications in SE \cite{Juristo2001,Wohlin2000,Wohlin2012-Experimentation,Basili-1986-ESE,Kitchenham2002-GuideLinesESE}, as well as to report it \cite{Jedlitschka2008,Kitchenham:2008b,Carver2010-GuidelinesReplication}; however, the variety of experimental protocols and report formats applied in practice far exceeds those methodological proposals \cite{Demagalhaes-2015-SMS-Replications}.

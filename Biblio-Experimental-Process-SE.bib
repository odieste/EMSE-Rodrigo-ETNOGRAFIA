	abstract={Randomization as a method of experimental control has been extensively used in human clinical trials and other biological experiments. It prevents the selection bias and insures against the accidental bias. It produces the comparable groups and eliminates the source of bias in treatment assignments. Finally, it permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood of chance as a source for the difference of end outcome. This paper discusses the different methods of randomization and use of online statistical computing web programming (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs or www.randomization.com) to generate the randomization schedule. Issues related to randomization are also discussed in this paper.},

	Abstract = {There is no empirical evidence whatsoever to support most of the beliefs on which software construction is based. We do not yet know the adequacy, limits, qualities, costs and risks of the technologies used to develop software. Experimentation helps to check and convert beliefs and opinions into facts. This research is concerned with the replication area. Replication is a key component for gathering empirical evidence on software development that can be used in industry to build better software more efficiently. Replication has not been an easy thing to do in software engineering (SE) because the experimental paradigm applied to software development is still immature. Nowadays, a replication is executed mostly using a traditional replication package. But traditional replication packages do not appear, for some reason, to have been as effective as expected for transferring information among researchers in SE experimentation. The trouble spot appears to be the replication setup, caused by version management problems with materials, instruments, documents, etc. This has proved to be an obstacle to obtaining enough details about the experiment to be able to reproduce it as exactly as possible. We address the problem of information exchange among experimenters by developing a schema to characterize replications. We will adapt configuration management and product line ideas to support the experimentation process. This will enable researchers to make systematic decisions based on explicit knowledge rather than assumptions about replications. This research will output a replication support web environment. This environment will not only archive but also manage experimental materials flexibly enough to allow both similar and differentiated replications with massive experimental data storage. The platform should be accessible to several research groups working together on the same families of experiments.},

	Abstract = {[Context] Replication Data Management (RDM) aims at enabling the use of data collections from several itera-tions of an experiment. However, there are several major chal-lenges to RDM from integrating data models and data from em-pirical study infrastructures that were not designed to cooperate, e.g., data model variation of local data sources. [Objective] In this paper we analyze RDM needs and evaluate conceptual RDM approaches to support replication researchers. [Method] We adapted the ATAM evaluation process to (a) analyze RDM use cases and needs of empirical replication study research groups and (b) compare three conceptual approaches to address these RDM needs: central data repositories with a fixed data model, heterogeneous local repositories, and an empirical ecosystem. [Results] While the central and local approaches have major issues that are hard to resolve in practice, the empirical ecosys-tem allows bridging current gaps in RDM from heterogeneous data sources. [Conclusions] The empirical ecosystem approach should be explored in diverse empirical environments.},

@article{Tosun-2017-experiment-TDD,
	Abstract = {Existing empirical studies on test-driven development (TDD) report different conclusions about its effects on quality and productivity. Very few of those studies are experiments conducted with software professionals in industry. We aim to analyse the effects of TDD on the external quality of the work done and the productivity of developers in an industrial setting. We conducted an experiment with 24 professionals from three different sites of a software organization. We chose a repeated-measures design, and asked subjects to implement TDD and incremental test last development (ITLD) in two simple tasks and a realistic application close to real-life complexity. To analyse our findings, we applied a repeated-measures general linear model procedure and a linear mixed effects procedure. We did not observe a statistical difference between the quality of the work done by subjects in both treatments. We observed that the subjects are more productive when they implement TDD on a simple task compared to ITLD, but the productivity drops significantly when applying TDD to a complex brownfield task. So, the task complexity significantly obscured the effect of TDD. Further evidence is necessary to conclude whether TDD is better or worse than ITLD in terms of external quality and productivity in an industrial setting. We found that experimental factors such as selection of tasks could dominate the findings in TDD studies.},

@inproceedings{Juristo-2012-Effectiveness-Testing,
	Abstract = {Some verification and validation techniques have been evaluated both theoretically and empirically. Most empirical studies have been conducted without subjects, passing over any effect testers have when they apply the techniques. We have run an experiment with students to evaluate the effectiveness of three verification and validation techniques (equivalence partitioning, branch testing and code reading by stepwise abstraction). We have studied how well able the techniques are to reveal defects in three programs. We have replicated the experiment eight times at different sites. Our results show that equivalence partitioning and branch testing are equally effective and better than code reading by stepwise abstraction. The effectiveness of code reading by stepwise abstraction varies significantly from program to program. Finally, we have identified project contextual variables that should be considered when applying any verification and validation technique or to choose one particular technique.},

@article{Gomez-2014-understanding-replication,
	Abstract = {Context
Replication plays an important role in experimental disciplines. There are still many uncertainties about how to proceed with replications of SE experiments. Should replicators reuse the baseline experiment materials? How much liaison should there be among the original and replicating experimenters, if any? What elements of the experimental configuration can be changed for the experiment to be considered a replication rather than a new experiment?
Objective
To improve our understanding of SE experiment replication, in this work we propose a classification which is intend to provide experimenters with guidance about what types of replication they can perform.
Method
The research approach followed is structured according to the following activities: (1) a literature review of experiment replication in SE and in other disciplines, (2) identification of typical elements that compose an experimental configuration, (3) identification of different replications purposes and (4) development of a classification of experiment replications for SE.
Results
We propose a classification of replications which provides experimenters in SE with guidance about what changes can they make in a replication and, based on these, what verification purposes such a replication can serve. The proposed classification helped to accommodate opposing views within a broader framework, it is capable of accounting for less similar replications to more similar ones regarding the baseline experiment.
Conclusion
The aim of replication is to verify results, but different types of replication serve special verification purposes and afford different degrees of change. Each replication type helps to discover particular experimental conditions that might influence the results. The proposed classification can be used to identify changes in a replication and, based on these, understand the level of verification.},

	Abstract = {Automation is the ability to perform a very well-practised task rapidly, smoothly and correctly, with little allocation of attention. This paper resports on experiments which sought evidence of automation in two programming subtasks, recognition of syntactic errors and understanding of the structure and function of simple stereotyped code segments. Novice and expert programmers made a series of timed decisions about short, textbook-type program segments. It was found that, in spite of the simplicity of the materials, experts were significantly faster and more accurate than novices. This supports the idea that experts automate some simple subcomponents of the programming task. This automation has potential implications for the teaching of programming, the evaluation of programmers, and programming language design. },

@article{Acunia-2015-personality,
	Abstract = {AbstractContext Research into software engineering teams focuses on human and social team factors. Social psychology deals with the study of team formation and has found that personality factors and group processes such as team climate are related to team effectiveness. However, there are only a handful of empirical studies dealing with personality and team climate and their relationship to software development team effectiveness. Objective We present aggregate results of a twice replicated quasi-experiment that evaluates the relationships between personality, team climate, product quality and satisfaction in software development teams. Method Our experimental study measures the personalities of team members based on the Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) and team climate factors (participative safety, support for innovation, team vision and task orientation) preferences and perceptions. We aggregate the results of the three studies through a meta-analysis of correlations. The study was conducted with students. Results The aggregation of results from the baseline experiment and two replications corroborates the following findings. There is a positive relationship between all four climate factors and satisfaction in software development teams. Teams whose members score highest for the agreeableness personality factor have the highest satisfaction levels. The results unveil a significant positive correlation between the extraversion personality factor and software product quality. High participative safety and task orientation climate perceptions are significantly related to quality. Conclusions First, more efficient software development teams can be formed heeding personality factors like agreeableness and extraversion. Second, the team climate generated in software development teams should be monitored for team member satisfaction. Finally, aspects like people feeling safe giving their opinions or encouraging team members to work hard at their job can have an impact on software quality. Software project managers can take advantage of these factors to promote developer satisfaction and improve the resulting product.},

As a result, when a designer is designing an object in an unfamiliar domain he will not have the same knowledge and skills available to him as when he is designing an object in a familiar domain. In this paper we look at the software designer's underlying constellation of knowledge and skills, and at the way in which this constellation is dependent upon experience in a domain. What skills drop out, what skills, or interactions of skills come forward as experience with the domain changes? To answer the above question, we studied expert designers in experimentally created design contexts with which they were differentially familiar. In this paper we describe the knowledge and skills we found were central to each of the above contexts and discuss the functional utility of each. In addition to discussing the knowledge and skills we observed in expert designers, we will also compare novice and expert behavior.},

Then, the questionnaire was applied on a semi-random sample of 176 software engineers from 20 software companies located in Recife-PE, Brazil. Results The survey results show the actual level of motivation for each motivator in the target population. Using principal component analysis on the values of all motivators, a five factor structure was identified and used to propose a guideline for the creation of motivational programs for software engineers. Conclusions The five factor structure provides an intuitive categorization for the set of variables and can be used to explain other motivational models presented in the literature. This contributes to a better understanding of motivation in software engineering.},

@article{Davies-design-activity,
	Abstract = {Early studies of programming and of other more general planning and problem-solving activities emphasized the hierarchical nature of such tasks. For instance, the dominant approach to problem-solving and planning views such processes as top-down focused activities which start from high level goals that are in turn decomposed into achievable actions via a successive refinement process. Similarly, empirical studies of the programming activity have highlighted such top-down and breadth-first decomposition strategies. These processes are also clearly mirrored in prescriptive accounts of the programming task. More recent characterizations of the programming activity present an alternative view-one which emphasizes the broadly opportunistic nature of the programming process. From this perspective, program design is seen to deviate from the top-down, breadth-first model proposed by previous studies. Here, program design is viewed as opportunistic in the sense that elements of the design can be created asynchronously at any level of abstraction within the solution space. Hence, the program design process is seen to be neither decompositionally nor hierarchically levelled, but mediated by the serendipitous and opportunistic discovery of new knowledge and design constraints and so on. The paper presents empirical support for a model of the program design activity which suggests that the programming process can neither be viewed as strictly top-down nor as globally opportunistic. Rather, it is shown that while opportunistic episodes may occur at any point in the evolution of a program, the programming activity itself is hierarchically structured and proceeds in a largely top-down fashion. Program design is seen as a hierarchical goal-directed task with random opportunistic excursions caused largely by simple cognitive failures.},

	Abstract = {Unit test-driven development (UTDD) is a software development practice where unit test cases are specified iteratively and incrementally before production code. In the last years, researchers have conducted several studies within academia and industry on the effectiveness of this software development practice. They have investigated its utility as compared to other development techniques, focusing mainly on code quality and productivity. This quasi-experiment analyzes the influence of the developers' experience level on the ability to learn and apply UTDD. The ability to apply UTDD is measured in terms of process conformance and development time. From the research point of view, our goal is to evaluate how difficult is learning UTDD by professionals without any prior experience in this technique. From the industrial point of view, the goal is to evaluate the possibility of using this software development practice as an effective solution to take into account in real projects. Our results suggest that skilled developers are able to quickly learn the UTDD concepts and, after practicing them for a short while, become as effective in performing small programming tasks as compared to more traditional test-last development techniques. Junior programmers differ only in their ability to discover the best design, and this translates into a performance penalty since they need to revise their design choices more frequently than senior programmers.},

	Abstract = {In recent years the explosive growth of smartphones and the evolution of mobile communication networks have certainly revolutionized the way how people communicate and access information. This revolution is even more tangible in developing countries where mobile devices are becoming the preferred way to access services for their daily activities. In this context, the development of mobile applications in the areas of health, education, agriculture, and mobile banking become a crucial factor. Unfortunately, the development process presents non-trivial human and technological challenges. The goal of our research is to support people living in developing countries to improve their lives. In particular we focused our attention on assisting farmers from rural zones of Sri Lanka in optimizing their crops.},

@article{Sharp-Role-Ethnographic-Studies-ESE,
	Abstract = {Ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. It is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. Ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. Despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. The main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. This is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. This article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. Throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.},

@article{Wohlin-2015-Towards-decision-making,
	Abstract = {Several factors make empirical research in software engineering particularly challenging as it requires studying not only technology but its stakeholders' activities while drawing concepts and theories from social science. Researchers, in general, agree that selecting a research design in empirical software engineering research is challenging, because the implications of using individual research methods are not well recorded. The main objective of this article is to make researchers aware and support them in their research design, by providing a foundation of knowledge about empirical software engineering research decisions, in order to ensure that researchers make well-founded and informed decisions about their research designs. This article provides a decision-making structure containing a number of decision points, each one of them representing a specific aspect on empirical software engineering research. The article provides an introduction to each decision point and its constituents, as well as to the relationships between the different parts in the decision-making structure. The intention is the structure should act as a starting point for the research design before going into the details of the research design chosen. The article provides an in-depth discussion of decision points in relation to the research design when conducting empirical research.},

	Abstract = {In experimental software engineering, particularly in the domain of predicting or identifying some properties (quality, cost, maturity, etc.), many methods have been proposed. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the software domain, the development process and style, etc., so there is no unique adequate method. The necessity of searching some adequate methods is recognized, but only few search techniques have been proposed thus far. Zhimin proposed a method mining technique for predicting error-prone modules based on a knowledge base consisting of a lot of prediction results. Here, we improve Zhimin's method and propose a general method mining model for experimental software engineering, which can search for some adequate methods on the basis of the performance knowledge base. We also show several applications and their mining results, for example, error-prone module prediction and traceability link recovery.},

@article{Vegas-2016-Crossover-Designs-ESE,
	Abstract = {In experiments with crossover design subjects apply more than one treatment. Crossover designs are widespread in software engineering experimentation: they require fewer subjects and control the variability among subjects. However, some researchers disapprove of crossover designs. The main criticisms are: the carryover threat and its troublesome analysis. Carryover is the persistence of the effect of one treatment when another treatment is applied later. It may invalidate the results of an experiment. Additionally, crossover designs are often not properly designed and/or analysed, limiting the validity of the results. In this paper, we aim to make SE researchers aware of the perils of crossover experiments and provide risk avoidance good practices. We study how another discipline (medicine) runs crossover experiments. We review the SE literature and discuss which good practices tend not to be adhered to, giving advice on how they should be applied in SE experiments. We illustrate the concepts discussed analysing a crossover experiment that we have run. We conclude that crossover experiments can yield valid results, provided they are properly designed and analysed, and that, if correctly addressed, carryover is no worse than other validity threats.},

	Abstract = {This paper repeats part of the analysis performed in the 1995 paper ``Experimental evaluation in Computer Science: a quantitative study'' by Tichy and collaborators, for 147 papers randomly selected from the ACM, published in the year 2005. The papers published in 2005 are classified in the following way: 4% theory, 17% empirical, 4.7% hypothesis testing, 3.4% other, and 70% design and modeling (using the 1995 paper categories). Within the design and modeling class, 33% of the papers have no evaluation. The numbers of the 2005 sample are very similar to the original figures for the 1995 sample, which shows that Computer Science research has not increased significantly its empirical or experimental component. },

@article{Bhatt-2010-Evolution-Clinical-Research,
	Abstract = {The evolution of clinical research traverses a long and fascinating journey. From the first recorded trial of legumes in biblical times to the first randomized controlled of trial of streptomycin in 1946, the history of clinical trial covers a wide variety of challenges - scientific, ethical and regulatory. The famous 1747 scurvy trial conducted by James Lind contained most elements of a controlled trial. The UK Medical Research Council's (MRC) trial of patulin for common cold in 1943 was the first double blind controlled trial. This paved the way for the first randomized control trial of streptomycin in pulmonary tuberculosis carried out in 1946 by MRC of the UK. This landmark trial was a model of meticulousness in design and implementation, with systematic enrolment criteria and data collection compared with the ad hoc nature of other contemporary research. Over the years, as the discipline of controlled trials grew in sophistication and influence, the streptomycin trial continues to be referred to as ground breaking. The ethical advances in human protection include several milestones - Nuremberg Code, Declaration of Helsinki, Belmont Report, and 1996, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidance. In parallel to ethical guidelines, clinical trials started to become embodied in regulation as government authorities began recognizing a need for controlling medical therapies in the early 20th century. As the scientific advances continue to occur, there will be new ethical and regulatory challenges requiring dynamic updates in ethical and legal framework of clinical trials.},

@inproceedings{Reyes-2016-Passwords,
	Abstract = {Background: These days, users are given access to information system functionalities through several security mechanisms, passwords being the most common form of access. There are many policies and rules, some stricter than others, to create passwords; however, they still remain vulnerable to attacks. Goal: In order to find out: the vulnerabilities of different passwords complexity levels created for this study, types of passwords used in attacks, and types of attackers and their origins; we conducted an empirical study. Method: This research was conducted through a controlled experiment. The study was based on honeypots emulating a SSH server, which was exposed to attacks for approximately 30 days on the Internet. Results: A large number of attacks were recorded, which were not capable of breaching any passwords complexity level. Conclusion: Although some attacks were carried out by means of sophisticated tools, none password complexity level was breached. We believe that it could be due to the experiment's duration was too short, or that the attackers simply did not have enough motivation to persist in the attempt to breach the access password to a site possibly listed as unattractive.},

	Abstract = {The many subfields in the wireless sensor networking literature include data fusion, data aggregation, remote environmental monitoring, sensing (temperature, pressure speed) and various military applications. The distance between sensor nodes can be measured by a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This study proposes both average and adaptive fuzzy logic algorithms for computing temperature in a monitored area. The main advantages of these methods are their simplicity and accuracy and better than the standard Manadni fuzzy logic method. Finally, comparison of the two methods in terms of root mean square error shows that the adaptive fuzzy logical algorithm with \{RSSI\} is better than average fuzzy logical algorithm for computing monitoring area temperature. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The advent of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) spurred a new direction of research in agricultural and farming domain. In recent times, \{WSNs\} are widely applied in various agricultural applications. In this paper, we review the potential \{WSN\} applications, and the specific issues and challenges associated with deploying \{WSNs\} for improved farming. To focus on the specific requirements, the devices, sensors and communication techniques associated with \{WSNs\} in agricultural applications are analyzed comprehensively. We present various case studies to thoroughly explore the existing solutions proposed in the literature in various categories according to their design and implementation related parameters. In this regard, the \{WSN\} deployments for various farming applications in the Indian as well as global scenario are surveyed. We highlight the prospects and problems of these solutions, while identifying the factors for improvement and future directions of work using the new age technologies. },

As days more and more agricultural data are virtually being harvested along with the crops and are being collected/stored in databases, the same data can be used in productive decision making if appropriate data mining techniques are developed/applied. An experiment was conducted with four consecutive (Kharif and Rabi) agricultural seasons in a semi-arid region of India to understand the crop-weather-environment-pest/diseases relations using wireless sensory and field-level surveillance data on closely related and interdependent pest/disease dynamics of groundnut crop. Association rule mining and multivariate regression mining techniques/algorithms were designed/ developed/tailor-made to turn the data into useful information/ knowledge/relations/trends to know crop-weather-environment-pest/disease continuum. These findings have been used for development of prediction models (cumulative and non-cumulative) followed by a web based pest/disease decision support system, which will help the decision makers to take viable ameliorative measures},

Sensor data stream is different from other traditional stream, the former is characterized by real-time, sequential, missing and imprecise. In the proposed system, the sliding window is used to model the sensor data stream, some fuzzy rules are constructed based on expert knowledge, and the fuzzy inference is used to collect different environmental parameter data stream to provide intelligent services for guiding irrigation control, disease prevention or other applications. The proposed forecasting system takes the sensor data stream as research objects and provides quantitative prediction services instead of vague judgments, which is the most useful for agricultural manager.},

	Abstract = {Ontologies are semantically organized collections of information pieces. Ontologies provide a way of organizing and encoding the collected knowledge for a given domain. Formalizing the accumulated knowledge in such a framework enables all sorts of automated analysis. We present an ontology for analyzing empirical studies of software engineering, in particular the design of software engineering experiments. The design of such experiments consists of assigning human subjects to apply treatments, such as techniques or tools, to artifacts such as code or specifications. The particular design and available treatments depend on the goals of the experiment. Provisions for addressing various threats to validity constrain the available design space. Furthermore, the assignments have to be consistent with the available resources. By encapsulating the existing knowledge on designing experiments, we posit that it is possible to check a given design for validity and consistency. We present a case study encoding software inspection experiments into an ontology and show how we can use it for checking a proposed design for a new inspection experiment.},

@inproceedings{Kallberg-2012-Cyber-Operations,
	Abstract = {The shift towards cyber operations represents a shift not only for the defense establishments worldwide but also cyber security research and education. Traditionally cyber security research and education has been founded on information assurance, expressed in underlying subfields such as forensics, network security, and penetration testing. Cyber security research and education is connected to the homeland security agencies and defense through funding, mutual interest in the outcome of the research, and the potential job market for graduates. The future of cyber security is both defensive information assurance measures and active defense driven information operations that jointly and coordinately are launched, in the pursuit of a cohesive and decisive execution of the national cyber defense strategy. The cohesive cyber defense requires universities to optimize their campus wide resources to fuse knowledge, intellectual capacity, and practical skills in an unprecedented way in cyber security. The future will require cyber defense research teams to address not only computer science, electrical engineering, software and hardware security, but also political theory, institutional theory, behavioral science, deterrence theory, ethics, international law, international relations, and additional social sciences. This paper is the result of an ocular survey of the U.S. 48 academic CAE-R research centers, evaluating the collective group of research centers' ability to adapt to the shift towards cyber operations, and the challenges therein.},

	Abstract = {Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile software development strategy that addresses both design and testing. This paper describes a controlled experiment that examines the effects of TDD on internal software design quality. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students in a software engineering course. Students in three groups completed semester-long programming projects using either an iterative test-first (TDD), iterative test-last, or linear test-last approach. Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition, test coverage, and external quality, and developer-centric aspects including productivity and confidence. In addition, iterative development approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach with manual tests. This study demonstrates the viability of teaching TDD with minimal effort in the context of a relatively traditional development approach. Potential dangers with TDD are identified regarding programmer motivation and discipline. Pedagogical implications and instructional techniques which may foster TDD adoption will also be referenced},

@article{Hannay-2009-effectiveness-pairprogramming,
	Abstract = {Several experiments on the effects of pair versus solo programming have been reported in the literature. We present a meta-analysis of these studies. The analysis shows a small significant positive overall effect of pair programming on quality, a medium significant positive overall effect on duration, and a medium significant negative overall effect on effort. However, between-study variance is significant, and there are signs of publication bias among published studies on pair programming. A more detailed examination of the evidence suggests that pair programming is faster than solo programming when programming task complexity is low and yields code solutions of higher quality when task complexity is high. The higher quality for complex tasks comes at a price of considerably greater effort, while the reduced completion time for the simpler tasks comes at a price of noticeably lower quality. We conclude that greater attention should be given to moderating factors on the effects of pair programming. },

	Abstract = {Requirement engineering is the most effective phase of software development process. It aims to collect good requirements from stakeholders in the right way. It is important for every organization to develop quality software products that can satisfy user's needs. Requirements engineering for software development process is a complex exercise that considers product demands from a vast number of viewpoints, roles, responsibilities, and objectives. Therefore, it becomes necessary to apply requirement engineering practices in every phase of software development process. In this paper, we propose an effective requirements engineering process model to produce quality requirements for software development. Requirement management and planning phase is executed independently for an effective management of requirements. It is iterative in nature for better requirement engineering and later maintenance. The successful implementation of proposed requirement engineering process can have a good impact on the production of quality software product.},

	Abstract = {There is an increasing number of contributions on how to solve the various problems within requirements engineering (RE). The purpose of this paper is to identify the main goals to be reached during the \{RE\} process in order to develop a framework for RE. This framework consists of three dimensions: * * the specification dimension * * the representation dimension * * the agreement dimension. We show how this framework can be used to classify and clarify current \{RE\} research as well as \{RE\} support offered by methods and tools. In addition, the framework can be applied to the analysis of existing \{RE\} practise and the establishment of suitable process guidance. Last but not least, the framework offers a first step towards a common understanding of RE. },

	Abstract = {Experimental replications are very important to the advancement of empirical software engineering. Replications are one of the key mechanisms to confirm previous experimental findings. They are also used to transfer experimental knowledge, to train people, and to expand a base of experimental evidence. Unfortunately, experimental replications are difficult endeavors. It is not easy to transfer experimental know-how and experimental findings. Based on our experience, this paper discusses this problem and proposes a Framework for Improving the Replication of Experiments (FIRE). The FIRE addresses knowledge sharing issues both at the intra-group (internal replications) and inter-group (external replications) levels. It encourages coordination of replications in order to facilitate knowledge transfer for lower cost, higher quality replications and more generalizable results.},

	Abstract = {[Context] Replication Data Management (RDM) aims at enabling the use of data collections from several itera-tions of an experiment. However, there are several major chal-lenges to RDM from integrating data models and data from em-pirical study infrastructures that were not designed to cooperate, e.g., data model variation of local data sources. [Objective] In this paper we analyze RDM needs and evaluate conceptual RDM approaches to support replication researchers. [Method] We adapted the ATAM evaluation process to (a) analyze RDM use cases and needs of empirical replication study research groups and (b) compare three conceptual approaches to address these RDM needs: central data repositories with a fixed data model, heterogeneous local repositories, and an empirical ecosystem. [Results] While the central and local approaches have major issues that are hard to resolve in practice, the empirical ecosys-tem allows bridging current gaps in RDM from heterogeneous data sources. [Conclusions] The empirical ecosystem approach should be explored in diverse empirical environments.},

	Abstract = {Engineering disciplines are characterised by the use of mature knowledge by means of which they can achieve predictable results. Unfortunately, the type of knowledge used in software engineering can be considered to be of a relatively low maturity, and developers are guided by reasoning based on intuition, fashion or market-speak rather than by facts or undisputed statements proper to an engineering discipline. This paper analyses the maturity level of the knowledge about testing techniques by examining existing empirical studies about these techniques. For this purpose, three categories of knowledge of increasing maturity have been presented and the results of these empirical studies have been placed in these three categories.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a distributed platform that gives researchers a framework to develop and deploy multi modal enabled experiments (haptic, audio, 3d vision), share them on the network with other research institutes and cooperate or remotely teleoperate with partners during the experiments. It gives also the possibility to see and collect significant data to be analyzed so that it's possible to achieve scientific results. All the experiments performed within the platform are real-time and fully interactive distinguishing the proposed Virtual Laboratory from other virtual laboratories that is possible to find in literature. The purpose of such platform is to enhance the speed of development of multi modal haptic enabled applications and improve the whole scientific experiment workflow. In particular the Virtual Laboratory platform is intended to supply a common shared place to perform inter-laboratories experiments and enhance the production of scientific results.},

	Abstract = {As scientific experiments and their analysis become increasingly automated, the need for workflow management support rises. Many workflow management systems tailored to scientific workflows have been developed. However, they are mainly stand-alone systems and ignore that many scientific research groups already store and manage experimental data in laboratory information systems, called LIMS. LIMS are typically web-based and allow researchers to insert and view experiment related data. In this paper we describe Exp-WF, a workflow management module that is designed to be incorporated into a typical LIMS such that workflow management and the traditional functionality of a LIMS co-exist. Scientists describe the execution order of experiments as a workflow model. Exp-WF then automatically selects experiments for execution and dispatches them to the people or machines responsible for performing them. Exp- WF extends existing workflow models to be able to handle the particularities of scientific experiment workflows. Exp- WF can be incorporated into an existing web-based LIMS in a nonintrusive way by using servlet filter technology to observe user actions and act upon them. Exp-WF uses agentbased technology with asynchronous communication to dispatch tasks to remote machines.},

@article{Meining-2006-XtalBase,
	Abstract = {The rate at which successful crystallization experiments and new structures of macromolecules are reported is growing at a fast pace. It is therefore desirable to collect data systematically, handle these data effectively and evaluate the accumulated knowledge in an automated fashion in order to optimize procedures for crystallization and data evaluation. A new web-based program, XtalBase, has been developed in order to aid the crystallographer in designing, preparing, documenting and evaluating crystallization experiments. XtalBase hosts a database of physicochemical data of compounds commonly used for the crystallization of macromolecules. Experimental conditions are constructed either from existing commercial screening sets, by random, by interpolation between start and end concentrations, or as sets of individually composed drops. Recipes needed for the preparation of solutions and drops are instantly calculated and displayed. The program allows for documenting observations in the form of scores, notes and pictures. The experimental data recorded within the program as well as data imported from the Biological Macromolecule Crystallization Database (BMCD) can be used to estimate a probability of success for crystallization conditions. The program enables the user statistically to correlate conditions with observations not only from their own experiments but from all experiments documented within the system. XtalBase provides facilities for storing a large variety of data, such as a sample history, collection and refinement parameters, coordinates, as well as publication data. Data can be imported and exported via customizable templates. The system can be configured to execute programs, which are fed by data from the database, and to extract data from the program output. The administrative interface allows the customization of all data tables and fields. All data can be searched in a unified search facility. The program presents the basis for a consistently defined database of crystallization data combined with tools to handle crystallization and crystallographic data via a web browser. The program home page is http:// www.xtalbase.net. {\copyright} 2006 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The Functional Genomics Experiment data model (FuGE) has been developed to facilitate convergence of data standards for high-throughput, comprehensive analyses in biology. FuGE models the components of an experimental activity that are common across different technologies, including protocols, samples and data. FuGE provides a foundation for describing entire laboratory workflows and for the development of new data formats. The Microarray Gene Expression Data society and the Proteomics Standards Initiative have committed to using FuGE as the basis for defining their respective standards, and other standards groups, including the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, are evaluating FuGE in their development efforts. Adoption of FuGE by multiple standards bodies will enable uniform reporting of common parts of functional genomics workflows, simplify data-integration efforts and ease the burden on researchers seeking to fulfill multiple minimum reporting requirements. Such advances are important for transparent data management and mining in functional genomics and systems biology. {\copyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The large and growing body of experimental data on biomolecular binding is of enormous value in developing a deeper understanding of molecular biology, in developing new therapeutics, and in various molecular design applications. However, most of these data are found only in the published literature and are therefore difficult to access and use. No existing public database has focused on measured binding affinities and has provided query capabilities that include chemical structure and sequence homology searches. Methods & results: We have created Binding DataBase (BindingDB), a public, web-accessible database of measured binding affinities. BindingDB is based upon a relational data specification for describing binding measurements via Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and enzyme inhibition. A corresponding XML Document Type Definition (DTD) is used to create and parse intermediate files during the on-line deposition process and will also be used for data interchange, including collection of data from other sources. The on-line query interface, which is constructed with Java Servlet technology, supports standard SQL queries as well as searches for molecules by chemical structure and sequence homology. The on-line deposition interface uses Java Server Pages and JavaBean objects to generate dynamic HTML and to store intermediate results. The resulting data resource provides a range of functionality with brisk response-times, and lends itself well to continued development and enhancement.},

SOA also addresses the critical security and privacy issues. This paper focuses on the investigation and studies on SOA based software engineering methods in the service engineering environment. Among the various SOA related software design and development methods available, service-oriented modeling and architecture (SOMA) service architectural environment is chosen as the target platform in the study. A web based service oriented ubiquitous Healthcare (u-Healthcare) software system was designed and implemented using the set of the software engineering methods developed in the study to gain empirical knowledge and experience on applying the approach to construct SOA service software.},

	Abstract = {Because biological systems with high-throughput performance generate huge amount of experimental data, biologists need efficient methods to analyze large datasets. Specifically, researchers in systems biology require the ability to compare and integrate complex data from different omics' experiments. This requirement results in the standardization of formats for data representation and communication. These standards can be categorized into three parts: reporting, data exchange and modeling, and terminology. Even though these standards are very helpful for analyzing data in each omics' experiment, we need to integrate them into unified standardized format for studies of systems biology because most researchers in systems biology require cross-omics' studies. To satisfy these requirements, we developed the object model for SMISB (System of Managing Minimum Information in Systems Biology). This model accommodates reporting, exchange, and management of data from five different omics such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.},

	Abstract = {Experimental studies have been used as a mechanism to acquire knowledge through a scientific approach based on measurement of phenomena in different areas. However it is hard to run such studies when they require models (simulation), produce amount of information, and explore science in scale. In this case, a computerized infrastructure is necessary and constitutes a complex system to be built. In this paper we discuss an experimentation environment that has being built to support large scale experimentation and scientific knowledge management in software engineering.},

This paper introduces myLEAD, a personalized information management tool for geoscience users. MyLEAD eases the data and information overload on the scientist by providing explicit solutions to the problems of structure, sharing, and preservation. This paper describes strategies within the myLEAD system to personalize data product and representation which ultimately leads to personalized workspaces and collaborative environments. We also include experimental results from some of the experiments that we conducted.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology research demands the availability of tools and technologies that span a comprehensive range of computational capabilities, including data management, transfer, processing, integration, and interpretation. To address these needs, we have created the bioinformatics resource manager (BRM), a scalable, flexible, and easy to use tool for biologists to undertake complex analyses. This paper describes the underlying software architecture of the BRM that integrates multiple commodity platforms to provide a highly extensible and scalable software infrastructure for bioinformatics. The architecture integrates a J2EE 3-tier application with an archival experimental data management system, the GAGGLE framework for desktop tool integration, and the MeDICi integration framework for high-throughput data analysis workflows. This architecture facilitates a systems biology software solution that enables the entire spectrum of scientific activities, from experimental data access to high throughput processing and analysis of data for biologists and experimental scientists.},

	Abstract = {Scientific research in many fields is increasingly a collaborative effort across multiple institutions and disciplines. Scientific researchers need not only an effective system to manage their data, results, and the experiments that generate the results, but also a platform to integrate, share and search these across multiple institutions. Therefore, researchers are able to reuse experiments, pool expertise and validate approaches. In this paper, we present Sci- Port, a system of experiment management and integration for collaborative scientific research. SciPort's architecture uses i) a general transformation-based data model to represent and link experiment processes; ii) hierarchical data classification across multiple institutions according to research programs' goals and organization; iii) metadatacentric representation that concisely captures the context of experiments; and iv) virtual data integration through centralized metadata integration. The system is built for open source, and the metadata-based representation and integration provides a unified framework and tool set to manage and share experiments for scientific research communities.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: An ontology of biological terminology provides a model of biological concepts that can be used to form a semantic framework for many data storage, retrieval and analysis tasks. Such a semantic framework could be used to underpin a range of important bioinformatics tasks, such as the querying of heterogeneous bioinformatics sources or the systematic annotation of experimental results. RESULTS: This paper provides an overview of an ontology [the Transparent Access to Multiple Biological Information Sources (TAMBIS) ontology or TaO] that describes a wide range of bioinformatics concepts. The present paper describes the mechanisms used for delivering the ontology and discusses the ontology's design and organization, which are crucial for maintaining the coherence of a large collection of concepts and their relationships. AVAILABILITY: The TAMBIS system, which uses a subset of the TaO described here, is accessible over the Web via http://img.cs.man.ac.uk/tambis (although in the first instance, we will use a password mechanism to limit the load on our server). The complete model is also available on the Web at the above URL.},

@article{faria-campos-2011-PRODIS-biologia,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:A research area that has greatly benefited from the development of new and improved analysis technologies is Proteomics and large amounts of data have been generated by proteomic analysis as a consequence. Previously, the storage, management and analysis of these data have been done manually. This is, however, incompatible with the volume of data generated by modern proteomic analysis. Several attempts have been made to automate the tasks of data analysis and management. In this work we propose PRODIS (Proteomics Database Integrated System), a system for proteomic experimental data management. The proposed system enables an efficient management of the proteomic experimentation workflow, simplifies controlling experiments and associated data and establishes links between similar experiments through the experiment tracking function.RESULTS:PRODIS is fully web based which simplifies data upload and gives the system the flexibility necessary for use in complex projects. Data from Liquid Chromatography, 2D-PAGE and Mass Spectrometry experiments can be stored in the system. Moreover, it is simple to use, researchers can insert experimental data directly as experiments are performed, without the need to configure the system or change their experiment routine. PRODIS has a number of important features, including a password protected system in which each screen for data upload and retrieval is validated; users have different levels of clearance, which allow the execution of tasks according to the user clearance level. The system allows the upload, parsing of files, storage and display of experiment results and images in the main formats used in proteomics laboratories: for chromatographies the chromatograms and lists of peaks resulting from separation are stored; For 2D-PAGE images of gels and the files resulting from the analysis are stored, containing information on positions of spots as well as its values of intensity, volume, etc; For Mass Spectrometry, PRODIS presents a function for completion of the mapping plate that allows the user to correlate the positions in plates to the samples separated by 2D-PAGE. Furthermore PRODIS allows the tracking of experiments from the first stage until the final step of identification, enabling an efficient management of the complete experimental process.CONCLUSIONS:The construction of data management systems for Proteomics data importing and storing is a relevant subject. PRODIS is a system complementary to other proteomics tools that combines a powerful storage engine (the relational database) and a friendly access interface, aiming to assist Proteomics research directly at data handling and storage.},

@article{murphy-1996-lab-LIMS-enterprise,
	Abstract = {The traditional view of a \{LIMS\} has been that its purpose is to help the laboratory to manage its data; this despite the fact that the `I' in \{LIMS\} is supposed to stand for information. The natural consequence of this approach has been that many \{LIMS\} have been defined purely in terms of the internal workings of the laboratory. This approach not only misses a number of opportunities to make the laboratory serve the business better, but can do an active disservice to the wider enterprise by failing to ensure that the right information is provided to the right customer at the right time. This paper will consider how to place the laboratory in its proper business context, and thus to define the system for true business benefit and obtain a budget for the project which reflects its value to the enterprise. },

	Abstract = {The final programs of the Pittsburgh Conference and Exposition on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy are reviewed to trace the origins of laboratory information management systems (LIMS) both as a topic in the technical program and as a product available in the exposition. The development of the literature of \{LIMS\} is examined, from the early articles in the trade press, through the key papers in the `A' pages of Analytical Chemistry, to the peer-reviewed journal published by Elsevier. the concurrent publication of books on \{LIMS\} is described. The origins and growth of the International \{LIMS\} Conferences and the \{LIMS\} Institute are described. The \{LIMS\} activities of the ASTM, the currently available short courses, and the most recent newsletter activities are summarized. },

	Abstract = {The main objective of High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) in catalysis and materials discovery, as well as in other areas, is to increase the total experiment count for a given time interval either by speeding up individual experiments and/or by running experiments in parallel. Typically, such screening experiments involve the preparation of sample libraries consisting of a large number of diverse materials together with the extensive variation of conditions during performance tests within a wide parameter space. As an important difference, when compared to molecular high-throughput screening, materials science does not always deal with uniquely defined entities. Every parameter during preparation and testing may be a factor crucial for the performance of the material. As a consequence, all experimental parameters should be controlled or at least recorded to be able to identify important correlations. The prime goal of the HTE cycle lies in speeding up the whole discovery and optimization process, but minimizing the costs and human efforts needed in the experimental workflow. In short, an increase in productivity will always result in a faster knowledge gain and therefore be a competitive advantage. This goal is only to be achieved by utilizing software tools at every single stage of the HTE process. In addition, the software platform has to provide an interface for data-mining/feature-extraction tools to gain insights required for discovering new useful materials. The software requirements in the HTE area can be classified according to the following aspects: ``support and tracking of material preparation (workflow management)'', ``planning and setting up experiments/performance tests'', ``process automation and control of hardware devices'', ``data logging and post-processing'', ``data storage, management and analysis''. Herein we present a modular approach to an HTE software platform. Instead of a monolithic master system, small tools with a limited set of tasks are interconnected using standardized, self-descriptive data structures. This approach is highly flexible with respect to the rapidly changing needs of the chemists: Since the modules are isolated and inter-module communication is standardized, new components (e.g., new devices) can be integrated into the process without any side effects. },

	Abstract = {During last years the interest on distance learning techniques has grown steadily as far as the use of electronic instruments in experimentation is concerned. Due to the higher and higher number of students accessing the university educational structures, the cost of laboratories for didactical electronic applications is going to be very high. As a consequence, a number of software tools and environments have been developed to help users to share distributed laboratory resources and realize virtual experiments. Nevertheless, further solutions have to be explored when students must be trained and experienced in the instrumentation programming. In this paper, we exploit modern software technologies to design and implement a distributed architecture for virtual labs allowing the approach previously described. Services integrated in this architecture aim to support students both to keep contact with real instruments both to remotely program instrumentation. This distance learning methodology is discussed and some reports from students experience with the system are showed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In general, professionals still ignore scientific evidence in place of expert opinions in most of their decision making. For this reason, it is still common to see the adoption of new software technologies in the field without any scientific basis or well-grounded criteria, but on the opinions of experts. Experimental Software Engineering is of paramount importance to provide the foundations to understand the limits and applicability of software technologies. The need to better observe and understand the practice of Software Engineering leads us to look for alternative experimental approaches to support our studies. Different research strategies can be used to explore different Software Engineering practices. Action Research can be seen as one alternative to intensify the conducting of important experimental studies with results of great value while investigating the Software Engineering practices in depth. In this chapter, a discussion on the use of Action Research in Software Engineering is presented. As indicated by a technical literature survey, along the years a growing tendency for addressing different research topics in Software Engineering through Action Research studies has been seen. This behavior can indicate the great potential of its applicability in our scientific field. Despite their clear benefits and diversity of application, the initial findings also revealed that the rigor and control of such studies should improve in Software Engineering. Aiming at better explaining the application of Action Research, an experimental study (in vivo) on the investigation of the subjective decisions of software developers, concerned with the refactoring of source code to improve source code quality in a distributed software development context is depicted. A Software Engineering theory regarding refactoring and some guidance on how to accomplish an Action Research study in Software Engineering supplement the discussions in this chapter. },

	Abstract = {This report describes an empirical study comparing three defect detection techniques: (a) code reading by stepwise abstraction, (b) functional testing using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, and (c) structural testing using branch coverage. It is a replication of a study that has been carried out at least four times previously over the last 20 years. This study used 47 student subjects to apply the techniques to small C programs in a fractional factorial experimental design. The major findings of the study are: (a) that the individual techniques are of broadly similar effectiveness in terms of observing failures and finding faults, (b) that the relative effectiveness of the techniques depends on the nature of the program and its faults, (c) these techniques are consistently much more effective when used in combination with each other.

@article{Juristo2011-RoleNonExactRepESE,
	Abstract = {In no science or engineering discipline does it make sense to speak of isolated experiments. The results of a single experiment cannot be viewed as representative of the underlying reality. Experiment replication is the repetition of an experiment to double-check its results. Multiple replications of an experiment increase the confidence in its results. Software engineering has tried its hand at the identical (exact) replication of experiments in the way of the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, etc.). After numerous attempts over the years, apart from experiments replicated by the same researchers at the same site, no exact replications have yet been achieved. One key reason for this is the complexity of the software development setting, which prevents the many experimental conditions from being identically reproduced. This paper reports research into whether non-exact replications can be of any use. We propose a process aimed at researchers running non-exact replications. Researchers enacting this process will be able to identify new variables that are possibly having an effect on experiment results. The process consists of four phases: replication definition and planning, replication operation and analysis, replication interpretation, and analysis of the replication's contribution. To test the effectiveness of the proposed process, we have conducted a multiple-case study, revealing the variables learned from two different replications of an experiment.},

	Abstract = {Context
Comparing and contrasting evidence from multiple studies is necessary to build knowledge and reach conclusions about the empirical support for a phenomenon. Therefore, research synthesis is at the center of the scientific enterprise in the software engineering discipline.
Objective
The objective of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in synthesizing software engineering research and their implications for the progress of research and practice.
Method
A tertiary study of journal articles and full proceedings papers from the inception of evidence-based software engineering was performed to assess the types and methods of research synthesis in systematic reviews in software engineering.
Results
As many as half of the 49 reviews included in the study did not contain any synthesis. Of the studies that did contain synthesis, two thirds performed a narrative or a thematic synthesis. Only a few studies adequately demonstrated a robust, academic approach to research synthesis.
Conclusion
We concluded that, despite the focus on systematic reviews, there is limited attention paid to research synthesis in software engineering. This trend needs to change and a repertoire of synthesis methods needs to be an integral part of systematic reviews to increase their significance and utility for research and practice.},

	Abstract = {Background: Several meta-analysis methods can be used to quantitatively combine the results of a group of experiments, including the weighted mean difference, statistical vote counting, the parametric response ratio and the non-parametric response ratio. The software engineering community has focused on the weighted mean difference method. However, other meta-analysis methods have distinct strengths, such as being able to be used when variances are not reported. There are as yet no guidelines to indicate which method is best for use in each case Aim: Compile a set of rules that SE researchers can use to ascertain which aggregration method is best for use in the synthesis phase of a systematic review. Method: Monte Carlo simulation varying the number of experiments in the meta-analyses, the number of subjects that they include, their variance and effect size. We empirically calculated the reliability and statistical power in each case Results: WMD is generally reliable if the variance is low, whereas its power depends on the effect size and number of subjects per meta-analysis; the reliability of RR is generally unaffected by changes in variance, but it does require more subjects than WMD to be powerful; NPRR is the most reliable method, but it is not very powerful; SVC behaves well when the effect size is moderate, but is less reliable with other effect sizes. Detailed tables of results are annexed. Conclusions: Before undertaking statistical aggregation in software engineering, it is worthwhile checking whether there is any appreciable difference in the reliability and power of the methods. If there is, software engineers should select the method that optimizes both parameters.},

@article{Pickard1998-CombiningEmpiricalResultSE,
	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the techniques used in medical research to combine results from independent empirical studies of a particular phenomenon: meta-analysis and vote-counting.

We use an example to illustrate the benefits and limitations of each technique and to indicate the criteria that should be used to guide your choice of technique. Meta-analysis is appropriate for homogeneous studies when raw data or quantitative summary information, e.g. correlation coefficient, are available. It can also be used for heterogeneous studies where the cause of the heterogeneity is due to well-understood partitions in the subject population. In other circumstances, meta-analysis is usually invalid. Although intuitively appealing, vote-counting has a number of serious limitations and should usually be avoided.

We suggest that combining study results is unlikely to solve all the problems encountered in empirical software engineering studies, but some of the infrastructure and controls used by medical researchers to improve the quality of their empirical studies would be useful in the field of software engineering.},

@article{Macneil2011-biolabsdata,
	Abstract = {Currently most biomedical labs in universities and government funded research institutions use paper lab notebooks for recording experimental data and spreadsheets for managing sample data. One consequence is that sample management and documenting experiments are viewed as separate and distinct activities, notwithstanding that samples and aliquots are an integral part of a majority of the experiments carried out by these labs.Various drivers are pushing labs towards integrated management of sample data and experimental data. These include the ever increasing amounts of both kinds of data, the increasing adoption of online collaborative tools, changing expectations about online communication, and the increasing affordability of electronic lab notebooks and sample management software. There is now an opportunity for smaller labs, which have been slow to move from paper to electronic record keeping, to leapfrog better resourced commercial labs and lead the way in adopting the new generation of tools which permit integrated management of samples and experimental data and a range of tangible benefits to conducting research, including:1. Fewer lost and mislabelled samples2. Clearer visualization of relationships between samples and experiments3. Reduction of experimental error4. More effective search5. Productivity gains6. More efficient use of freezers, leading to cost reduction and enhanced sustainability7. Improved archiving and enhanced memory at the lab and institutional levels.},

@article{Glass2000,
	Annote = {Two years ago, we adopted the policy that any one publishing a quantitative study in the journal would have to agree to archive all the raw data at the journal website so that the data could be downloaded by any reader. Our authors have done so with enthusiasm. I think that you can see how this capability puts an entirely new face on the problem of how we integrate research findings: no more inaccurate conversions of inferential test statistics into something worth knowing like an effect size or a correlation coefficient or an odds ratio; no more speculating about distribution shapes; no more frustration at not knowing what violence has been committed when linear coefficients mask curvilinear relationships. Now we simply download each others' data, and the synthesis prize goes to the person who best assembles the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle into a coherent picture of how the variables relate to each other.

First, the high cost in the past of publishing research results led to cryptic reporting styles that discarded most of the useful information that research revealed. To encapsulate complex relationships in statements like "significant at the .05 level" was a travesty---a travesty that continues today out of bad habit and bureaucratic inertia.},

	Abstract = {Where the creation, understanding, and assessment of software testing and regression testing techniques are concerned, controlled experimentation is an indispensable research methodology. Obtaining the infrastructure necessary to support such experimentation, however, is difficult and expensive. As a result, progress in experimentation with testing techniques has been slow, and empirical data on the costs and effectiveness of techniques remains relatively scarce. To help address this problem, we have been designing and constructing infrastructure to support controlled experimentation with testing and regression testing techniques. This paper reports on the challenges faced by researchers experimenting with testing techniques, including those that inform the design of our infrastructure. The paper then describes the infrastructure that we are creating in response to these challenges, and that we are now making available to other researchers, and discusses the impact that this infrastructure has had and can be expected to have.},
	Annote = {- Obtaining the infras- tructure necessary to support such experimentation, however, is difficult and expensive.
- studies of humans, which are likely to be more expensive.
- Controlled experimentation is expensive
- experiment design and process details are often not standardized or reported in sufficient detail.},

As a result, recording, archiving and sharing descriptions of these processes and of the results of experiments is becoming ever more challenging. However, validation of results, sharing of best practice and integrated analysis all require systematic description of experiments at carefully determined levels of detail. The present paper discusses issues associated with the management of experimental data in the life sciences, including: the different tasks that experimental data and metadata can support, the role of standards in informing data sharing and archiving, and the development of effective databases and tools, building on these standards.},

@inproceedings{Shull2002-TacitKnoeledge,
	Abstract = {Recently the awareness of the importance of replicating studies has been growing in the empirical software engineering community. The results of any one study cannot simply be extrapolated to all environments because there are many uncontrollable sources of variation between different environments. In our work, we have reasoned that the availability of laboratory packages for experiments can encourage better replications and complementary studies. However, even with effectively specified laboratory packages, transfer of experimental know-how can still be difficult. A cooperation between Brazilian and American researchers addressing effective running of replications was formed in 1999. One of the specific issues being addressed is the problem of transferring tacit knowledge. We discuss what we learned about the tacit knowledge transfer problem and the evolution of laboratory packages in the description of a replication performed in Brazil using a PBR (Perspective Based Reading) laboratory package; also how further issues are addressed.},
	Address = {Washington, DC, USA},
	Annote = {- In this paper, we review our experiences in experimental replication leading us to identify an important tacit knowledge problem affecting the process conformance and hence the comparability of results between replications.
- (Here, tacit knowledge refers to information that is important to the experiment but is not coded into the lab package. It lies in the head of the original experimenters and has a difficult time being made explicit, for a variety of reasons.)
- As argued in this paper, we now believe that effective replications require not only lab packages but also a process of replication involving the original researchers to support their instantiation, evolution, and use.
- The need for such a process implies an associated need for an effective collaboration structure between the original and replicating researchers to convey the tacit knowledge that is important for process conformance.
- However, despite our high hopes, our experience has shown that replication is difficult and lab packages are not the solution by themselves. Even when both the original experimenters and the replicating researchers are experienced experimentalists, there are so many sources of variation and implicit assumptions about the experimental context that composing a static lab package to describe all relevant aspects of the experiment, in such a way that unexpected sources of variation are not introduced into the replication, is nearly impossible.},

	Abstract = {A wide range of models supports process improvement in organizations, nevertheless, the absence of a universal model becomes necessary to combine complementary models. The aim of this work is to design and to evaluate SFramework, a useful model for process improvement, because facilitates the reference models combination. The methodology used is Design Science Research (DSR), which prescribes the design and evaluation phases of the new artifact and use of a set of guidelines for this purpose. The design phase develops an agile structured model with generic phases; so, it can be generalizable. In evaluation phase, a case study based on IT standards and best practices is used; the structure and the content of the required documentation for business continuity process are defined. This study evidences that SFramework is operational and technically feasible and the effort expended in its application is relatively low; therefore, it is applicable for process improvement in environments SME type. Also shows a successful case using DSR and complementary methods.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents key activities necessary for designing and analyzing an experiment in software engineering. After explaining how to choose an appropriate research technique to fit project goals, the paper shows how to state a hypothesis and determine how much control is needed over the variables involved. If control is not possible, then a formal experiment is not possible; a case study may be a better approach. Next, the six stages of an experiment (conception, design, preparation, execution, analysis and dissemination) are described, with design examined in detail. Design considerations such as replication, randomization and local control are discussed, and design techniques such as crossing and nesting are explained. Finally, data analysis is shown to be a function both of the experimental design and the distribution of the data. Throughout, examples are given to show how the techniques are interpreted and used in software engineering.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Empirical software engineering has a long history of utilizing statistical significance testing, and in many ways, it has become the backbone of the topic. What is less obvious is how much consideration has been given to its adoption. Statistical significance testing was initially designed for testing hypotheses in a very different area, and hence the question must be asked: does it transfer into empirical software engineering research? This paper attempts to address this question. The paper finds that this transference is far from straightforward, resulting in several problems in its deployment within the area. Principally problems exist in: formulating hypotheses, the calculation of the probability values and its associated cut-off value, and the construction of the sample and its distribution. Hence, the paper concludes that the topic should explore other avenues of analysis, in an attempt to establish which analysis approaches are preferable under which conditions, when conducting empirical software engineering studies.},

	Abstract = {The United Nations Organization for Industrial Development requested the International Organization for Standardization the development of an international standard for energy management, within the framework of the industries' needs to have an effective response to climate changes. As a result, the ISO 50001 standard was published in 2011. This standard specifies the guidelines for the implementation of Energy Management Systems in companies, through a continuous cycle of improvements. Due to the standard's recentness, it is necessary to determine the software systems and its application that could support the industry to facilitate the standard's application. This work aims to know the current software systems development trend regarding the use of ISO 50001 standard. We perform a preliminary Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), as a research method, in order to establish the state of the art about the incorporation of ISO 50001 standard into software systems for energy management. 8 primary studies were found as a result of this research, which were categorized into two groups: studies who describe a methodology to apply the standard, and studies who propose a software system for implement the standard. There are few studies reporting software systems for energy management based on ISO 50001 standard; hence, we believe that it is necessary to make a greater effort for the research and development of this area.},

	Abstract = {Software development for the communication networks' monitoring is usually based on Open Source software components, as an effective and low cost technological option. However, when we evaluated a product developed with Open Source components, we found that its efficiency is less than other similar Open Source software developed with proprietary tools; which is unusual or at least it isn't expected. To the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been reported in the literature. Hence, our aim was to identify the circumstances that explain why the efficiency of Open Source software applications tends to be less than Open Source applications developed with proprietary software tools. A controlled experiment was performed at Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE of Ecuador to compare the performance of two software tools for communication networks' monitoring. A post hoc analysis reveled that some causal relationships that could explain the unexpected behavior of compared applications' efficiency. From the statistical perspective, there is no significant difference in effectiveness between Open Source and proprietary applications for communication networks' monitoring. Efficiency of the Open Source tools depends on a large extent of software components used for their integration, which apparently is not considered in the development of this kind of applications.},

It is not the intent to summarize all the possible details involved with performing these tests, but instead to offer insight into evaluating the statistical methods found in published articles. Historically, the number of scientific articles published in which inappropriate statistical analyses were performed is alarming. Only when the reader understands the problem and demands change will this situation improve. The consequence of inaction is to be mired with an array of poorly designed articles that, at the very least, do not advance the field of study and, at worse, may influence practitioners not well versed in statistics to expose patients to useless, unnecessary, or even harmful procedures.},

	Abstract = {The Software Engineering Research community has slowly recognized that empirical studies are an important way of validating ideas and increasingly our community has stopped accepting the sufficiency of arguing that a smart person has come up with the idea and therefore it must be good. This has led to a flood of Software Engineering papers that contain at least some form of empirical study. However, not all empirical studies are created equal, and many may not even provide any useful information or value. We survey the gradual shift from essentially no empirical studies, to a small number of ones of questionable value, and look at what we need to do to insure that our empirical studies really contribute to the state of knowledge in the field. Thus we have the good, the bad, and the ugly. What are we as a community doing correctly? What are we doing less well than we should be because we either don't have the necessary artifacts or because the time and resources required to do "the good" is perceived to be too great? And where are we missing the boat entirely in terms of not addressing critical questions and often not even recognizing that these questions are central even if we don't know the answers. We look to see whether we can find some commonality in the projects that have really made the transition from research to widespread practice to see whether we can identify some common themes.},

	Abstract = {Blind people need to become as independent as possible in their daily life in order to guarantee a fully social inclusion. Mobility means the possibility of freely moving, without support of any accompanying person, at home, in public and private buildings, and in open spaces, as the streets of the town. Mobile and wireless technologies, and in particular the ones used to locate persons or objects, can be used to realize navigation systems in an intelligent environment. Such systems open new opportunities to improve the speed, easiness, and safety of the visually impaired persons mobility. Using these technologies together with Text To Speech systems and a mobile-based database the authors developed a cost effective, easy-to-use orientation and navigation system: RadioVirgilio/SesamoNet1. The cost effectiveness is due to the recovery of RFID identity tags from cattle slaughtering: these tags are then borrowed to create a grid used for navigation. In this paper the results of an usability analysis of this guide system are presented. A preliminary experiment involving a small group of experts and a blind person is described. In order to evaluate the usability, three cognitive walkthrough sessions have been done to discuss the system's basic functionality and to highlight the most critical aspects to be modified.},

	Abstract = {A computer vision-based wayfinding and navigation aid can improve the mobility of blind and visually impaired people to travel independently. In this paper, we develop a new framework to detect and recognize stairs and pedestrian crosswalks using a RGBD camera. Since both stairs and pedestrian crosswalks are featured by a group of parallel lines, we first apply Hough transform to extract the concurrent parallel lines based on the RGB channels. Then, the Depth channel is employed to further recognize pedestrian crosswalks, upstairs, and downstairs using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Furthermore, we estimate the distance between the camera and stairs for the blind users. The detection and recognition results on our collected dataset demonstrate that the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.},
